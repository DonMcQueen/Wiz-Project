# Wiz-Project Read Me

Thanks for stopping by! This is a walkthrough of the technical project assigned by the Wiz team for the CSA role. In this Read Me, you will find:
- What we are building. Think of the tools, services, software, etc. required to complete the assessment
- Notes. Which parts were difficult to build, which parts were more straightforward, which parts were ambiguous, etc.
- References to other files used in the project. These could be IAM role json, terraform files, secrets files, Cloud Provider files, etc.
- Final Thoughts.
